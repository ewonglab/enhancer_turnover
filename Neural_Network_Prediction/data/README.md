## Datasets

Datasets are used in "Evolutionary sequence divergence predicts functional changes to TF binding in enhancer turnover" section.

There are two sets of datasets.
- human-specific enhancers and their matched non-enhancer counterpart in mouse
- mouse-specific enhancers and their matched non-enhancer counterpart in human

More specificly, we got four files here.

- human_enhancers_hg38_functional.bed
- mouse_enhancers_hg38_non.functional.bed (matched non-enhancer counterpart)

- mouse_enhancers_mm10_functional.bed
- human_enhancers_mm10_non.functional.bed (matched non-enhancer counterpart)
